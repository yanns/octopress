During the [play framework meetup in Mai 2015](http://www.meetup.com/Play-Berlin-Brandenburg/events/222130013/), there were 3 talks about Dependency Injection (DI) in Play 2.4:

- runtime DI in Java with [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice), the default framework introduced in play 2.4: https://github.com/schleichardt/play-2-4-di-talk

- runtime DI in Scala with [Scaldi](http://scaldi.org/): http://scaldi.github.io/scaldi-play-2.4.0-presentation/

- compile-time DI in Scala with constructor arguments or [MacWire](https://github.com/adamw/macwire): http://de.slideshare.net/yann_s/play-24dimacwire
