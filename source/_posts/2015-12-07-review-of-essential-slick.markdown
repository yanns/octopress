I had the pleasure to review the book "[Essential Slick](http://underscore.io/books/essential-slick/)" about [Slick 3](http://slick.typesafe.com/).

I really appreciated the lecture. For anyone starting a project with Slick, I highly recommand this book, in particulary to learn about:

- how to build queries that can be composed and re-used
- how to structure the code
- the patterns, anti-patterns and pitfalls to avoid.


The book goes through a lot of concepts, from simple queries and data-modeling to views, projections, joins and aggregates.

Slick 3 has very powerful concepts that could be hard to manage. The book tries to teach us how to use them. 

Some steps are sometimes high, like in the 2nd chapter, where Queries, Actions, Effects, Streaming are introduced in a few pages.

But once the step managed, I had the feeling to have the good abstractions in my mind to build an application based on Slick. And I could use these concepts to solve the exercises.


What I really liked:

- exercices: I think I can only learn a library when I use it and the exercises in the book are a very good opportunity to practice.
- the sbt console is configured so that I could copy/paste all examples from the book into the console and play with them.
- focus on composability and re-usability
- the book also shows when one abstraction is not optimal for one problem and propose some alternatives.

What I missed:

- Slick 3.0 is a lot about asynchronity, streaming and I wish the book could dig further in these concepts.

All in all, a very good book!
